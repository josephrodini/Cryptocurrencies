# Cryptocurrencies

Using unsupervised machine learning to uncover trends in cryptocurrencies

## Overview

This project helps a client who is interested in offering a portfolio of several cryptocurrencies. Specifically, it creates figures and visualizations to elucidate what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they can be grouped to create a classification system. A clustering algorithm and two scatterplots were generated.

## Resources

- Technology: Jupyter Notebook, Python with Pandas, Plotly, hvPlot, and skLearn

- Data source: crypto_data.csv

## Deliverables

- Deliverable one: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Deliverable two: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Deliverable three: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Deliverable four: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies 

## Code

Please see [crypto_clustering](https://github.com/josephrodini/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/crypto_clustering.ipynb) for pre-processing, PCA, K-means, and generation of visualizations.

## Results

## Conclusion

Using unsupervised machine learning, the client now has data and visualizatios to help them plan their portfolio.
